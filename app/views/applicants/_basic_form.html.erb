			<strong>Engineering: </strong>Students are exposed to basic design analysis and engineering graphics.  Engineers are team leaders that plan, design and supervise engineering projects from concept to completion.  Engineers solve problems by relying on their creative and academic skills.  You should enjoy problem solving and be challenged by the effort it requires.  Students are required to complete Calculus by the time they graduate from high school.
		</p>
        	<strong>Technology: </strong>Students will be introduced to tools and techniques involving  manufacturing logistics, SAP (Systems, Applications and Products), engineering graphics, and many other topics that will allow students to earn certificates and experiences that are highly sought after by employers.  Engaging in technology supports working as part of a team focused on completing an operation or task.  Technology majors prepare for practical design and applied use of tools and techniques to manage projects and solve problems.  Students are required to complete Trigonometry by the time they graduate from high school.
