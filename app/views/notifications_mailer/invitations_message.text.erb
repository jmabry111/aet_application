AET Overview
Through a partnership with Danville Community College (DCC) and the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research (IALR), students enrolled within the AET program will have the opportunity to earn college credits in engineering, mathematics, and English. The program focuses on exposing students to the rigor of engineering, so that they may be better prepared to determine if engineering is a path they wish to continue at a university.

Engineers are team leaders that plan, design, and supervise engineering projects from concept to completion. Engineers solve problems by relying on their creative and academic skills. The successful student should enjoy problem solving and challenged by the effort it requires. Communication and logical thought progression are skills that will be reinforced throughout the AET program.

Core Requirements:  Students within the Academy for Engineering and Technology are expected to conduct themselves in a respectable and mature manner.  The successful student within the AET program will pride themselves in the following ways:
