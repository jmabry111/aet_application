AET Overview
Through a partnership with Virginia State University (VSU), the New College Institute (NCI) created the Academy for Engineering and Technology starting with the 2012-2013 school year.  Students enrolled within the AET program will have the opportunity to choose between two tracks of study: engineering or technology.  Credits earned within either track are aligned such that they may transfer to ABET accredited universities upon successful completion of the program.

Engineering:  Students are exposed to basic design analysis and engineering graphics.  Engineers are team leaders that plan, design and supervise engineering projects from concept to completion.  Engineers solve problems by relying on their creative and academic skills.  The successful student should enjoy problem solving and challenged by the effort it requires.  Students are required to complete Calculus by the time they graduate from high school.  

Technology:  Students will be introduced to tools and techniques involving manufacturing logistics, SAP (Systems, Applications and Products), engineering graphics, and many other topics that will allow students to earn certificates and experiences that are highly sought after by employers.  Engaging in technology supports working as part of a team focused on completing an operation or task.  Technology majors prepare for practical design and applied use of tools and techniques to manage projects and solve problems.  Students are required to complete Trigonometry by the time they graduate from high school.  

* The technology track is not currently offered at IALR for the 2014-2015 school year

Experiential Learning:  Along with the academic courses offered with both tracks, students will participate in many experiential learning activities throughout the curriculum to apply their academic knowledge to on-the-job situations.  These include interactions (guest lectures) with individuals in career fields of engineering, technology and advanced manufacturing; exposures to high tech industry through onsite tours; and the opportunity for paid, hands-on internships with industry leaders of Southern Virginia and throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.


Core Requirements:  Students within the Academy for Engineering and Technology are expected to conduct themselves in a respectable and mature manner.  The successful student within the AET program will pride themselves in the following ways:

	A.  Ability/Interest in hands-on application of classroom learning
	B.  Demonstrates:
•	Excellent attendance and conduct
•	Enthusiasm in learning at the university level
•	Focus on note-taking
•	Works well both individually and in group settings
•	Excellent analytical and communication skills
•	Ability to be a self-starter

C.  Passion/aptitude for math, problem solving, and technology usage
D.  Self-accountable for college level behavior
