	<p>
		Rising juniors enrolled within the AET program will have the opportunity to choose between two tracks of study: engineering or technology.  Credits earned within either track are aligned such that they may transfer to ABET accredited universities upon successful completion of the program.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Engineering:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are exposed to basic design analysis and engineering graphics.  Engineers are team leaders that plan, design and supervise engineering projects from concept to completion.  Engineers solve problems by relying on their creative and academic skills.  The successful student should enjoy problem solving and is challenged by the effort it requires.  Students are required to complete Calculus by the time they graduate from high school.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Technology:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will be introduced to tools and techniques involving manufacturing logistics, SAP (Systems, Applications and Products), engineering graphics, and many other topics that will allow students to earn certificates and experiences that are highly sought after by employers.  Engaging in technology supports working as part of a team focused on completing an operation or task.  Technology majors prepare for practical design and applied use of tools and techniques to manage projects and solve problems.  Students are required to complete Trigonometry by the time they graduate from high school.  <br />
		<em><i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i>&nbsp;<strong>The technology track is not currently offered at IALR.</strong></em>
	</p>
	<p>
    <strong>Experiential Learning:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;AET students will participate in many experiential learning activities throughout the curriculum to apply their academic knowledge to on-the-job situations. These include interactions (guest lectures) with individuals in career fields of engineering, technology and advanced manufacturing; exposures to high tech industry through onsite tours. Rising juniors enrolled in AET are eligible to participate in the Industry Fundamentals program and rising seniors enrolled in AET are eligible to apply for an opportunity to be selected for a paid internship.
